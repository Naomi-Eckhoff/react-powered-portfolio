          The best way to contact me would be to shoot me an email. As a person who has been on the internet
          before I don't feel comfortable including too much information. It's easy enough to find me as it is.

        <p>
          I can be reached at <a href="mailto:nsuibhne@gmail.com">nsuibhne@gmail.com</a>
        </p>
      </div>
    </section >
